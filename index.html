        <h5> King and Queen of the Trash ü§¥üë∏ </h5>
        <p>
          The moment I locked eyes with you I felt something special.
          You captivated me with your inconceivable beauty and amazing personality.
          You had the most beautiful smile I had ever seen and the most contagious
          laugh I have ever heard. You made me feel so warm and I just had a feeling
          that I wanted to be with you. The moment that really solidified my interest
          in you was when you trusted me to get on top of the trash can and stomp around
          like we were king and queen of the dumpster! This was the best night of my
          life Maja because I found the most perfect girl in the world.

        <h5> Always up for an adventure ü§ü</h5>
        <p>
          I remember thinking when we first started talking that you were the coolest girl of all time. You always were down to take a risk and it made me feel so good that you had trust in me. You were willing to take me up to your cabin just a month after meeting me. You were willing to risk it all and come to a hick themed bar crawl in Madison. We traveled to Duluth for the day and had a hell of a time. You even allowed me to come to your entire family reunion, just a month after we started dating! I am so incredibly excited for our future together. We are going to travel the globe, try new foods and see new things and I feel so blessed to be able to do it with the most wonderful girl in the world.

        <h5> So easy with you üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë© </h5>
        <p>
            I love hanging out with you every second of the day. I remember our first nights together, zero responsibilities, talking all night and not even realizing the sun was up because of your blackout shades. The passion I have for sharing your presence has not waned one bit, you are my addiction, and I feel so lucky to be with you. I love nothing more in life than laughing with you, watching movies all night, and talking really big ideas about our future together. You make loving life so easy because it is such a treat to be with you Maja.

              We can go out to the bar, sing in the car. Everything I do, as long as I'm with you, I'm happy.

              Canoeing on calhoun, watching the stars and moon. Everything I do, as long as I‚Äôm with you, I'm happy.

              Sleeping so little, sharing a bag of skittles. Everything I do, as long as I‚Äôm with you, I‚Äôm happy.

              The simplest things in life never felt so awesome, you are just the cutest little blossom.

        <h5> The Prettiest of Smiles üòÉ</h5>
        <p>
            Maja, you have the most incredible, unimaginable, awe-inspiring smile I have ever seen. You light up a room when you walk in it, and I'm so unbelievably lucky to be able to look at it every day. You make bad days amazing, you make me happy when I‚Äôm sad, you make me laugh at times I didn‚Äôt think I could laugh. I love being able to see your gorgeous smile and hear your contagious laughter. I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to love someone the way I love you. Thank you for always cheering me up and making me feel so amazing inside!
